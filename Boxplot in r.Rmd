###Creating a boxplot

The simplest way to do this is just to specify Gender as the variable to be plotted on the x-axis, and the hygiene scores (day1) to be the variable plotted on the y-axis. As such, when we initiate our plot object rather than set a single variable as an aesthetic as we did for the histogram (aes(day1)), we set Gender and day1 as variables (aes(Gender, day1)). Having initiated the plot object (Iâ€™ve called it festivalBoxplot), we can simply add the boxplot geom as a layer (+ geom_boxplot()) and add some axis labels with the labs() function as we did when we created a histogram. To see the graph we therefore simply execute these two lines of code:

```{r}
festivalBoxplot <- ggplot(festivalData, aes(gender, day1))
festivalBoxplot + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = "Gender", y = "Hygiene (Day 1 of Festival)")
```

The resulting boxplot is shown in Figure 4.19. It shows a separate boxplot for the men and women in the data. Note that the outlier that we detected in the histogram is shown up as a point on the boxplot (we can also tell that this case was a female). An outlier is an extreme score, so the easiest way to find it is to sort the data:

```{r}
festivalData<-festivalData[order(festivalData$day1),]
festivalBoxplot + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = "Gender", y = "Hygiene (Day 1 of Festival)")

```
